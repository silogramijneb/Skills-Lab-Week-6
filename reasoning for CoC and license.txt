We chose the Apache License 2.0 because it's an open source license that clearly details what the user can and cannot do. It allows the user to do more or less
whatever they want with our program, and we feel that that is how it should be. Furthermore, our code of conduct is the Code Covenant one that Professor Burton
recommended. We feel that it does a good job at making sure the user does not misuse our program, or use it to harm others if possible.
